# Feed Reader Testing Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). This project required me to build a suite of tests for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Udacity provided the HTML, CSS and Javascript for the feed reader application. I wrote the test suite using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html).

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the Javascript Testing section of my course.

Specifically I practiced:
* writing tests for a web-application using the Jasmine framework.
* using Jquery for DOM traversal

## Getting Started
You can try the Feed Reader here:
https://srykov.github.io/fend-feedreader/

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the list of tests that ran against the application.

You should see the following list of tests:
* RSS Feeds
	* are defined
	* urls are not empty
	* names are not empty
*The menu
	* is hidden by default
	* changes visibility when clicked
* Initial Entries
	* contains at least a single entry
* New Feed Selection
	* causes content to change
